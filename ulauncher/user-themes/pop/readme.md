This is a Ulauncher theme for Pop!_OS users. I've tried to keep the UI clean and consistent with the default Pop!_OS GTK theme.

## Installation

1. Download the files from this repo
2. Navigate to /home/<user>/.config/ulauncher
3. Create a folder called user-themes
4. Create another folder within user-themes called pop
5. Copy the files from this repo to the new pop folder
6. Change the theme with Ulauncher's preferences window
